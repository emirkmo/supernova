# supernova

Object-oriented python library for analyzing supernova data, focusing on generic data flow and conversion. 
The scripts are meant to be imported and used inside external plotting and analysis codes/notebooks (not included in this repo)

Will also be a way to quickly import the SN data from my papers. However, please do not take it without
referring to/citing the paper, (or publish it before mine without contacting me), thanks
